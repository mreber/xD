<p id="shayetext">Shaye Saint John is a fictional character that used web media to facilitate and mediate their likeness and personality</p>

<br>

<br>

<p id="shayetext">Using the web was the only way this character was able to exist. Through their YouTube presance, they took advantage of video making and post production editing to create a fictonal-believability of the character.

<br>

<br>


<p id="shayetext">As time passes, the audience is able to sit with the content for a longer period of time and can see that the character can be read as a model for queerness, giving perspectives on ideas of self image, and gender. These discussions can happen in real time, maybe even easier due to the internet. Shaye Saint John would not be a known artist if it weren't for the organic structures of internet algorythms, allowing one of Shaye's videos to become viral opening up these avenues for discussion.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p id="shayetext">Shaye Saint John has a full website that describes the story and some personality traits of their character. It is a very inviting website titled <I>HELLO AGAIN!</I>, a very smart way to invite the audience into the characters world. This not only reinforces the characters existence but gives you an outlet to partake in its story. This is a very good example of how Web Art can define a specific type of artistic practice, and how it intersects with different mediums. Through the lens of Shaye Saint John we are seeing a performative video practice intersect with a Web Art practice.</p>

<p id="shayetext">Shaye Saint John created the website in (2003) and the YouTube channel in (2006). This summarizes how the internet acted before social media was in full force. If you understood coding and html, you could create a page that described whatever you wanted to say or do. Shaye Saint John is an example of someone that had an idea for this work and took advantage of the up and coming internet media to realise it. By using a website the character became more excessible and allowed for Shaye to carry out their own individual specifically weird narrative.</p>
